# DJ Emotion Recognition App

A cross-platform mobile app for DJs to analyze and visualize **crowd emotions in real-time** during live sets, helping improve song choices and audience engagement.

## Features

🎶 **Real-Time Emotion Detection**  
Uses the device camera and a Flask backend with `fer` and OpenCV to detect emotions in the crowd during your DJ set.

📈 **Post-Set Analytics**  
Displays graphs of crowd emotion trends over time to help DJs reflect and improve future sets.

📱 **Cross-Platform**  
- **iOS (React Native)** 
- **Andorid (React Native)** 

🔐 **User Authentication**  
JWT-based auth system to securely store and retrieve session data.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React Native, TypeScript
- **Backend:** Flask, Python, OpenCV, `fer`
- **Auth:** JWT
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **Hosting:** AWS EC2 for backend, AWS RDS for database

## How it works

1. The app captures crowd images every few seconds.
2. The Flask backend analyzes emotions frame-by-frame.
3. Emotion data is stored and visualized on a graph.
4. DJs can review which songs engaged the crowd best.

## Setup (Coming Soon)

🚧 Deployed to App Store, currently in beta testing stage.

## Roadmap

✅ Frontend and backend integration  
✅ JWT user authentication  
✅ Emotion detection pipeline  
✅ Data visualization and CSV export  
✅ Deployment on AWS  
🚧 (Future plans) Shazam integration for track logging

## Why I built this

As a DJ, I often wondered how the crowd was actually feeling during sets beyond what I could see or guess. This app is designed to provide **objective feedback** on crowd engagement, helping DJs improve their track selection, energy flow, and connection with the audience.
